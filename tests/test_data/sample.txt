I tested ten marketing videos. The "No Money Startup Pro" GPT rated them for startups with no money. Here's what I found:
The crash course scored highest.
Four videos tied at 85. One showed how to learn digital marketing. Another packed 13 years of lessons into 85 minutes. A third crammed 30 years into 53 minutes. The last gave ten proven strategies.
Godin's talk on building an audience scored 80.
Two videos tied at 75. A basic marketing intro lacked depth. Another Godin talk needed more real-world examples.
A 46-minute video with 17 years of advice scored 70.
Last was a TED talk on AI in marketing, scoring 60.
