I tested ten marketing videos. The "No Money Startup Pro" GPT rated them for startups with no money. Here's what I found:

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:10.351
The crash course scored highest.

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:23.970
Four videos tied at 85. One showed how to learn digital marketing. Another packed 13 years of lessons into 85 minutes. A third crammed 30 years into 53 minutes. The last gave ten proven strategies.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.793
Godin's talk on building an audience scored 80.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:34.834
Two videos tied at 75. A basic marketing intro lacked depth. Another Godin talk needed more real-world examples.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.717
A 46-minute video with 17 years of advice scored 70.

00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:42.331
Last was a TED talk on AI in marketing, scoring 60.
